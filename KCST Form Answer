### 12. Scope / Objectives of the Project

**1. Enable System Recovery**
To develop a reliable system restore utility that allows Linux users to recover their entire operating system to a previous working state within minutes, similar to Windows System Restore or macOS Time Machine.

**2. Dual Snapshot Mode Architecture**
To implement two distinct backup mechanisms:
- RSYNC mode using hard-links for space-efficient backups on any Linux filesystem (ext4, XFS, F2FS)
- BTRFS mode leveraging native Copy-on-Write snapshots for near-instantaneous operations

**3. Space-Efficient Storage**
To achieve up to 90% storage savings through intelligent hard-linking, where unchanged files across snapshots share the same disk blocks.

**4. Automated Protection**
To implement scheduled backups at configurable intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, boot-time) with customizable retention policies.

**5. Comprehensive System Support**
To support diverse system configurations including LUKS-encrypted partitions, LVM volumes, and GRUB2 bootloader configurations.

**6. Visual Change Tracking**
To develop a snapshot diff viewer showing exactly what files changed between snapshots.

---

### 13. Methodology

**Approach:**

**1. Layered Architecture Design:**
- GUI Layer (GTK3): MainWindow, BackupWindow, RestoreWindow, SettingsWindow
- Core Layer: Snapshot management, scheduling logic, device detection
- Utility Layer: RsyncTask, Device handling, CronTab integration
- System Layer: Integration with rsync, btrfs-progs, GRUB2

**2. RSYNC Hard-Link Implementation:**
```bash
rsync -aii --recursive --delete --sparse \
    --link-dest=<previous_snapshot> \
    --exclude-from=<exclude_list> \
    / <snapshot_path>
```
When rsync encounters unchanged files, it creates hard-links pointing to existing disk blocks, enabling each snapshot to appear as a complete filesystem while sharing storage.

**3. BTRFS Native Snapshots:**
```bash
btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /@ /timeshift/snapshots/<name>/@
btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /@home /timeshift/snapshots/<name>/@home
```
Leverages filesystem-level Copy-on-Write for instantaneous, atomic snapshots.

**Tools & Technologies:**

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Core Language | Vala (compiles to C via valac) |
| GUI Framework | GTK3 (libgtk-3) |
| Build System | Meson 0.54+ |
| Backup Engine | rsync with hard-links |
| Filesystem | BTRFS snapshots, ext4, XFS |
| Data Format | JSON (configuration, metadata) |
| Scheduling | Linux Cron |
| Encryption | LUKS/cryptsetup integration |

## Page 4 - Outcomes & Industry Relevance

### 14. Expected Outcome of the Project

1. **Functional Desktop Application:**
   A complete system restore utility with both graphical (GTK3) and command-line interfaces, capable of creating, managing, and restoring filesystem snapshots.

2. **Dual-Mode Backup System:**
   - RSYNC mode working on ext4, XFS, and other traditional filesystems
   - BTRFS mode with native Copy-on-Write snapshot support

3. **Space Efficiency:**
   Demonstrated storage savings of up to 90% through hard-linking, where a 20GB system with 5 daily snapshots uses approximately 25GB total instead of 100GB.

4. **Automated Protection:**
   Working cron-based scheduling with hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly backup policies and automatic retention management.

5. **Enhanced Features:**
   - Snapshot Changes Viewer for visual file diffs
   - Export to external drives for offsite backup
   - User configuration backup capability
   - Optimized size calculation with queued I/O

6. **Cross-Distribution Support:**
   Successfully tested and functional on Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint, and Debian-based distributions.

### 15. Is the Project Relevant to Industry/Society/Institution?

**Yes / No:** Yes

**Details:**
The project is highly relevant to:

1. **Educational Institutions:** Computer labs require frequent system resets between classes or sessions. LinuxRollback enables quick restoration without complete reinstallation.

2. **Small/Medium Enterprises:** Businesses running Linux workstations need protection against system failures. This solution reduces IT support time and costs.

3. **Developer Community:** Developers frequently experiment with configurations that may break their systems. Quick rollback capability is essential.

4. **Linux Mint/Ubuntu Community:** The project extends the widely-used Timeshift utility with additional features.

**Contact Details:**
- Linux Mint Community: https://linuxmint.com
- Ubuntu Forums: https://ubuntuforums.org

**Industry Support:** Open-source community support; no external funding.

---

### 16. Can the Product be Patented?

**Yes / No:** No

**Reason:** The project is based on open-source technologies (rsync, BTRFS) and extends the GPLv2-licensed Timeshift project. It is intended to remain open-source under GPL license.

**Prior Art Search Done?**
**Yes / No:** Yes

Prior art includes: Timeshift, Snapper, BackInTime, Duplicity - our project differentiates by combining RSYNC and BTRFS modes with system-focused approach and visual diff features.
